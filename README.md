# workoutplanner

Welcome to the workoutplanner app. This app is a Sinatra based web application that allows users to create an account and plan out their workouts with their favorite exercises. They'll be able to create exercises, see (read) all of their exercises at their home page, as well as options to edit (update) and delete their exercises from their workouts. 

### Future updates

Another update needs to be made that will focus on styling and adding a feature that lets the user organize their exercises and designate workouts for each day of the week. Additional object relationships and tables need to be added.
